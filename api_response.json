We will have a specific set of questions so the board will ask each and every question 1 by 1 and after that the interview will give the response. So each question proceeds by the interview response and then what suits according to the original answer to Cragability. These 3 things we store and once the interview got over we give all those details in a pdf format by comparing the knowledge of particular interview whether they are ok or they have to focus or if they have to focus then what I have worked on I have not provided them the exact point but in that question some points are mentioned please tell me sorry, please write or speak some specific points about reject not general 1.

So whenever you use 4 0, the normal 1 GPT, the moment you press enter, it starts giving you the answer, right? Is that GBD is going to, you know, think about it and it's going to check itself back.

But you have to be very familiar with Next Jas. Like, even if you, for example, use are using an image let's assume, okay? So you should always use it with the functions that Next Jas has given you. Like, next Jas has its own image tag. If you use it with that, your image will be the most optimized. Like, you need to know the next Jazz to get everything out of it. It's a really really nice to, you know. Have you ever used Olama?",

It's by meta and you can just download and run LLM in your terminal, you know, and it's like 2 click install. It's very nice. You know, I'll tell you 1 project which my friend made, okay. So, friend and me both we made, okay? So, we had 1 STS exam. He had an STS exam, okay? In that STS exam what was that like this dude is a mat coder, okay? Like he lives and breeds making programs and everything. So, he got into a this thing. He had a bet with his STS teacher that it's basically competitive coding that like I am going to get full. Ok and he made a bet he came back and he is like I don't wanna study for it. I don't want to study for this random exam, I can work on something better. So, you know what he did? I think in like 5, 6 hours, he built a complete, I don't know how to say this, a cheating tool, ok. So basically, he had found a bug in repeal with which he can host things for however long he wants. However long he wants to. Replate I think you must have used, right? It's an online ID.",

        "dialogue": "So he took LamA and he hosted it over there. Ok? Then he wrote 1 portable Python program, okay? With which what it, what it does is that it takes input from your mouse and your keyboard, okay? And whenever you will press 4 slashes and type out something and then you end that with 4 slashes, that's basically that goes as a request to the LLM that is there, and once the response comes, the program takes over your keyboard and it starts writing out code for you.",

Right? So, he had configured in a way that on the top left of the screen if the mouse goes, the typing will stop. Top right was resumed, bottom left was cancelled and the bottom right he had just left. So like Madame Point. Math program and he finished his exam in like 10 to 15 minutes and he left and he got to full also and you know so many people in for that exam are like 1 script, okay, with which you can run in your JavaScript console. With which you can chatGPT this thing basically. It's an API end point with which you can make the call you will get the response and you can just copy the response from there. Ok.
